	
An ambigram is a calligraphic or typographic design with multiple interpretations as written words.
Alternative meanings are often yielded when the design is transformed or the observer moves, 
but they can also result from a shift in mental perspective. 
This animation shows a half-turn ambigram of the word ambigram. 
The word is written calligraphically with 180-degree rotational symmetry,
such that it reads identically when viewed upside down.
